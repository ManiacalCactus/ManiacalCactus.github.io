I'm a high school student from New York.  I've been passionate about electronics, mechanical engineering, and robotics for as long as I can remember.  Here I post not only what I build, but the entire nitty gritty process of how I went about building it, including all of the failures and disappointments along the way.  Hopefully I will be posting at a bare minimum of every two weeks.  The content ranges from projects to my thoughts on a new technology to anything else I find intriguing at the time.  If you have any questions or comments, shoot me an email at lkopits.extra@gmail.com.

Regarding this website itself, I built it very simply using Jekyll and it is hosted on github pages.  Someday I may migrate to something made from scratch, but my webdev skills are not yet to that level.
